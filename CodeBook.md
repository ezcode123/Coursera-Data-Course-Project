\par
Their description on how the data was generated follows here (extracted from the above link), where the term "feature" refers to the variable:\par
\par
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. \par
\par
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). \par
\par
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). \par
\par
\par
\par
\par
Statistics were calculated on each variable, with only the mean and standard deviation selected for analysis here.\par
\par
\par
\par
## Variables\par
\par
\par
\par
The following describes the variables which were selected for further analysis.  The form below is the final one, not that of the original study, with the special characters removed and typos corrected.  The measurements were all normalized, ranging from -1 to 1 and, thus, are unitless.\par

Subject = A number assigned to one of thirty individuals who carried the cell phone while doing activities\par
Activity = The activity performed while wearing the cell phone, one of six activities:\par
\tab *WALKING\par
\tab *WALKING_UPSTAIRS\par
\tab *WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS\par
\tab *SITTING\par
\tab *STANDING\par

\par
\par
For the final data table, "Mean." was added to the front of each variable, indicating that the mean was taken of each by subject and activity.\par
