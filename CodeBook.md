The data is available at:

"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones"  

Their description on how the data was generated follows here (extracted from the above link), where the term "feature" refers to the variable:

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 




Statistics were calculated on each variable, with only the mean and standard deviation selected for analysis here.

Analysis was parsed by two variables:

Subject = A number assigned to one of thirty individuals who carried the cell phone while doing activities

Activity = The activity performed while wearing the cell phone, one of six activities:

*WALKING
*WALKING_UPSTAIRS
*WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
*SITTING
*STANDING
*LAYING



##  Final Data


For the final data table, "Mean." was added to the front of each variable, indicating that the mean was taken of each by subject and activity.
